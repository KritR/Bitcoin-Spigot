# Bitcoin-Spigot
Bitcoin faucet extractor for back when bitcoin faucets were profitable.

There was a time period between 2008-2016 in which people would handily give away small amounts of bitcoin in exchange for you visiting their site.

Only problem for sketchy pillagers like me was the captcha... and sheer amount of time one would have to spend pillaging.

So the opportunistic young lad I was created this ... pseudofunctional script to try and extract as much money as I could out of these faucets... complete with a captcha solving mechanism, a non functional proxy switcher, and automated form filling.

This program is no longer of any use, but could serve as potential reference for programmers in later cryptolucky times.
